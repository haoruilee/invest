# Asset Selection Criteria

Existence for more than 20 years
Good liquidity
Backtest can survive all historical crises, with a drawdown of less than 5% under a dollar-cost averaging strategy
Theoretically, long-term growth
Still a worthwhile investment 20 years from now
No need for constant reevaluation or re-pricing, and it will never make me buy or sell in panic, nor challenge my human nature on any given day
